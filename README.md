# bash-ip-tcp-udp
Bash script for checking the reachability of TCP and UDP ports on a specified IP address. The script allows users to specify the protocol (TCP or UDP), IP address, start port, and end port as command-line arguments. It relies on standard Unix utilities such as ping and timeout to perform the port checks.
